[Original Post](http://asianbarbie.com/binary-search-trees/)

**Binary search trees (BSTs) are simply binary trees with one additional caveat: all the nodes with values smaller than the root go on the left, and all the nodes with values bigger than the root go on the right.**

Insertion is easy: start at the root, and keep doing node value comparisons until you reach a leaf node. Above, we see that a new member who has been assigned the value 11. To insert herself as a node in the sororitree, she starts at the root node, makes a comparison (is 11 bigger than 7?), goes right to Node 9 as a result of that comparison, makes another comparison (is 11 bigger than 9?), and goes right again. Since Node 9 has no right little, Node 11 becomes the right little of Node 9.

The sorority metaphor can get a little confusing sometimes (especially if you’re not in a Greek organization — my school doesn’t have Greek life, so I’ve been doing a lot of research). Let’s go through a simple example to further clarify how to insert into a BST.
