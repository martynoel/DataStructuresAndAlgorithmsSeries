**Trees — they’re all around us in real life, providing us with fresh oxygen, giving us comfortable places to sit under and read, and acting as cool backgrounds to pose by.**

(Okay, maybe that last one’s a me thing.)

As it turns out, trees are also all around us in the digital world. They’re the underlying data structures behind most file systems, library catalogs, 3D video games, network routers, music compression algorithms, and more. We just can’t see them, so we often don’t know that they’re there.


Like in real life, data structure trees (which I’ll call “trees” from here on out) come in many shapes, sizes, and specifications. Some are balanced, others are not. Some are tall, others are short. Some are efficient and have widespread applications, others are incredibly inefficient and are used for teaching purposes only.
