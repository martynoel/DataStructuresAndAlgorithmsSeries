# How to Study Data Structures and Algorithms

**When I first started studying algorithms, I had an incredibly hard time because of two things.** 

One, I didn’t have a very strong mathematical foundation, and would struggle to understand the reasoning behind certain algorithms. Two, I was just plain bored. “Implement insertion sort and time your algorithm input on arrays of size 10,000…” Ugh! I approached my assignments with the same sort of dread that one normally reserved for seeing disagreeable relatives during the holidays: Yeah, sure, I’ll bang out this code as quickly as possible and retreat to my room to watch Rick and Morty the first chance I get. 

Because I had such an approach, it was painful to study algorithms. Even worse, the knowledge didn’t stick. I couldn’t remember a damn thing after I’d handed in an assignment. Insertion sort? How was that different from Merge Sort, or Selection Sort, or, God forbid, BogoSort? 

## The Importance of Curiosity and Excitement

Do you remember the first time you saw your favorite band live? (I use a lot of concert metaphors, deal with it). You were probably excited for weeks beforehand, counting down the days you had left before you were there, picking out your outfit, and re-listening to every track on the commute to the venue. If I asked you to describe the event to me, you could most likely do it in great detail -- how the fans were screaming, the stage effects they had going, what the band was wearing, the guy who was puking by the trash cans in the bathrooms because he’d gotten a little too hype, that one awkward moment in the middle of a song when the lead singer kind of tripped and --

-- Okay, so that was my experience, not yours, but you’d be able to describe it in just as vivid detail, couldn’t you? 

It’s because you were fully in the moment. You wanted to be there, you were excited about it, you breathed in the atmosphere, and your brain committed every single little detail to memory. And while learning about algorithms may not be quite as exciting as going to see your favorite band perform live, we’re going to train your brain to remember what you learn in the same way -- by getting excited, getting curious, and being completely present while learning. 

## Maximizing Your Study Environment

I SEE YOU, people-who-say-they’re-studying-but-are-really-messing-around-with-friends-and-checking-Snapchat-every-two-minutes. 👀 You don’t really think you’re getting anything out of that kind of low-grade study time, do you? 

I don’t want to hear your excuses. If you’re serious about retaining information, get your ass out of your overly-social, messy, cluttered, noisy, or otherwise distracting environment, and park yourself in the most isolated, quiet section of the library (that’s where I’m typing this right now!). If you must bring a friend, choose someone who’s going to be doing their own thing and not bothering you when you’re busy learning about algorithms. 

If getting to a quiet environment isn’t a possibility for you, clear off a space where you can work without being distracted, plug in your headphones, and blast that focus music. This is a trick I use during hackathons or while working in open office spaces when I really need to concentrate. It has the same-ish effect as being in the quiet section of the library, although I prefer the quiet more. 

We all have our different ways of studying -- I bring blank pieces of computer paper with me and take extensive notes, but you may be satisfied with just looking at the screen -- so I won’t go into detail about that here, but I will mention that humans’ productivity cycles have been pretty well-studied, and we’re found to have natural 90 minute peaks followed by 30 minute breaks. I’ve tested this out myself and found that it really does work to my advantage. 

Set an alarm for 90 minutes and give it all you’ve got. Then, give yourself a 30 minute break away from your computer (I like to walk outside, find a nice place, and meditate for 20 of those 30 minutes). Your brain will use this time to subconsciously solidify what you’ve just learned, and you’ll return refreshed and curious -- the best state to be in. :)

## The Algorithmic Mindset

Okay, so you’ve found a great study spot, turned on that focus music, and are ready to dive in, but you find that you still can’t get super enthusiastic about algorithms. Trust me, I feel you on this. Looking at just the material from a surface level doesn’t exactly make me too stoked either.

My trick is to reframe what I’m about to do so that I get more excited about it. When it comes to sorting algorithms, specifically, I pretend that I’m training some alien intelligence who understands natural order (that 1 comes before 2 and A comes before B, etc), but has literally no idea how to put things in order. This means that I’ll have to tell it both the order I want to put things in (usually smallest to largest), and also how to do it (the actual algorithmic implementation!). 

It amuses me to think of each step as an instruction for an alien, and I have more fun learning. You may think of something else -- they key is to adjust your mindset so that what you’re about to do is actually enjoyable. It’s not that hard, and I guarantee you’ll learn more when you like what you’re doing. 

## Your approaches

Give this method a try! I can almost guarantee that it’ll work out for you. If you have any suggestions on how to improve this article, please let me know. 

I’m also interested in your own approaches on how to make studying algorithms more interesting! Like, seriously, please tell me, and I’ll update the post to include your tips, too. 

Good luck studying! I hope this helps you have more fun while doing so.
